# portfolio

This portfolio is a project that showcases my knowledge and implementation of web development best practices.

(Below will be deleted upon completion of portfolio.)

## Practice

Through this project, I was able to practice the following:

- Writing HTML
- Writing CSS using SCSS and the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) Methodolgy
- SCSS: Creating Variables
- Working with Git Branches and pushing code from my Working Directory to a Remote Repository in GitHub.

## Features

#### User Interaction

- Identifies user location and time using IP address
- Stores and retrieves name and page visit information to browser (local storage)

## Challenges and Learnings

## Resources

## Thanks

### MVP

- [x] You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
- [x] In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
- [x] You are to use SCSS for styling.
- [ ] You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.
- [ ] !!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths.
      VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (we will see Media Queries next week, docs to follow)

### other requirements

- [ ] a landing page/section with your name and title on it.
- [ ] An About page/section with a little bit about you
- [ ] A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
- [ ] A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
- [ ] A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link
